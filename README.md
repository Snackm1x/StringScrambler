# StringScrambler
This is a console application that takes in two strings and then scrambles their words together.

## Kevin you could try some of the following for learning/fun:
- Push a different button to do something else like "Alternate Words"
- Clean up the code. It's currently poorly written you could split it out into functions and clean it up.
- Add error handling
- I'll think of some other things haha
